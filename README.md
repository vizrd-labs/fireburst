#Made by Raunak Sudhakar, as ViZrdLabs.


#Demo

You need two devices to run it (or atleast two browser windows).

"Controller" on: https://fireburst.herokuapp.com/

"Screen" on: https://fireburst.herokuapp.com/screen/

Allows multiple devices as "controllers" to send "Fireworks" to the "Screen". You need a second screen/device to actually see the "fireworks". Should work with lots of people on lots of devices "sending coloured rockets". The use case was for a Crowd in front of a projector (or a Google meet). One screen that runs the "screen" app. Everyone on their phones with the "controller" to send fireworks. 

Made it mostly so my students sould cheer eachother work during class/reviews. :)
